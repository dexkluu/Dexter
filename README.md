# Projects
## [Restaurant Review Dashboard](https://dexkluu.github.io/Restaurant-Review-Dashboard/)
Because restaurants are a customer service business, insights in how a restaurant is performing can be gained by observing customer sentiments in online reviews. Reviews for a restaurant were scraped off the web using Python's scrapy, processed to show meaningful information, and displayed in a Tableau dashboard. The dashboard is able to clearly show recent monthly performance in terms of customer ratings as well as common keywords in their reviews all in one place.

## [Anime Recommender](https://dexkluu.github.io/Anime-recommender/)
Item-based collaborative filtering was done on user rating data that I scraped off of [myanimelist.net](https://myanimelist.net). The recommender system allows users to enter ratings for animes they have watched(as a Python dictionary) and will return 10 recommended animes.

## [Features that Affect Anime Rating and Ranking](https://dexkluu.github.io/Features-affecting-animated-media-rating-and-rank/)
This project focuses on exploring what features about an anime tended to perform better. The analysis looks into genres, voice actors, production studios, and media type. The goal was to gain insight into what the public was interested in and what they ultimately enjoyed.

## [Mammogram Mass Classification](https://dexkluu.github.io/Mammogram-Mass-Classification/)
Mass data was used to classify the severity of the mass through different machine learning models. The models accuracy, precision, and recall score were compared to make a conclusion about the best performing model.
