# Projects
## [Anime Recommender](https://dexkluu.github.io/Anime-recommender/)
Item-based collaborative filtering was done on user rating data that I scraped off of [myanimelist.net]. The recommender system allows users to enter ratings for animes they have watched(as a Python dictionary) and will return 10 recommended animes.

## [Features that Affect Anime Rating and Ranking](https://dexkluu.github.io/Features-affecting-animated-media-rating-and-rank/)
This project focuses on exploring what features about an anime tended to perform better. The analysis looks into genres, voice actors, production studios, and media type. The goal was to gain insight into what the public was interested in and what they ultimately enjoyed.

## [Kanji Flashcard Formatter](https://dexkluu.github.io/Kanji-Flashcard-Structure/)
My interest in Japanese media has inspired me try and learn a bit of Japanese. This project searches up kanji meanings and structures the data in a way so that Quizlet can make all of the flashcards at once.

## [Mammogram Mass Classification](https://dexkluu.github.io/Mammogram-Mass-Classification/)
Mass data was used to classify the severity of the mass through different machine learning models. The models accuracy, precision, and recall score were compared to make a conclusion about the best performing model.
